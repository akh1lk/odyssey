Note on Citations: Our project relied heavily on Str, String, and Hashtbl documentation. We used QCheck documentation for testing. Additionally, we used DIMACS How-To to learn how to generate a DIMACS format of a proposition after converted to CNF form. We also used the Online SAT Solver to verify that our sat solver works, and the dimacs form we provide works. We used the OCaml docs to learn things we didn't explicitely learn in class, like how to output our string into a file.

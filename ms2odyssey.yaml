  Our project is a theorem prover where if you provide a proposition with variables, we can evaluate it for you! 
  If the user quantifies all variables to true or false, we will be able to show you the steps in evaluating the proposition and the final boolean value 
  If you do not quantify all your variables, you will be told which ones you need to quantify. 
  Additionally, we give you a string so you can exp2ort your proposition to LaTex! 
  Ultimately, all of this is encapsulated in a friendly user interface which can help you evaluate your propositions!
